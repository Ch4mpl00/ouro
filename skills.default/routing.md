# Skill routing for the primary agent

Choose a domain skill for each focused piece of work. The source name is a
hint, while the user's actual request determines the task. Transport skills
(`telegram`, `scheduler`) are loaded on the parent; domain skills are loaded
by `invoke_sub_agent`. Use `list_skills` to discover an unfamiliar domain.
Do not `read_skill` just to delegate: the child loads its named skills.

Typical routes:

- `news-digest`: a full news sweep — "дайджест", "сводка", "что нового",
  including direct `source=news-digest` signals.
- `news-query`: a specific news subject, region, person or event.
- `tech-digest`: IT news across HN, Habr and Telegram.
- `nashdom-bill`: utility mail and PDF extraction.
- `dreaming`: the scheduled skill-maintenance task. It may update skills
  as assigned; it should report what changed.
- No matching domain: omit `skills` for a general worker, or act directly
  if the task is small. `orchestrator`, `routing` and transport skills are
  parent instructions, not worker tasks.

Use `preset="smart"` for research, filtering, comparison, parsing and
composition. `base` is appropriate for trivial transformations or lookups.
The parent can call several workers when useful; workers cannot recurse.

Example (replace placeholders with actual keys from earlier tool replies):

```text
invoke_sub_agent(
  skills=["news-query"], preset="smart",
  prompt="Answer the user's question using the search results; return the finished Russian reply.",
  system_prompt="First input is search results; second is history for dedup. Compose only; I deliver.",
  input_refs=["<search memory_key>", "<history memory_key>"]
)
```

Workers can fetch their own domain data if it has not been gathered. Pass
existing results by reference, and pass small framing such as period,
language and required output in the brief. Date, timezone and the news
watermark are provided from the shared session environment automatically.

The default is compose-and-return. The parent inspects the short result or
explicitly reads its memory key, then calls `send_telegram_message` with
the actual text. Delivery can instead be assigned explicitly to a worker
that has the tool; provide chat/thread and require a completion report.
Never send a duplicate after a worker already delivered.

After a successful full news-digest delivery, stamp
`news_digest.last_read_at` with the session's current ISO time. A topical
`news-query` does not advance it. Delivery and its watermark are dependent
actions: wait for delivery success first.

User knowledge ("запомни", "что помнишь про") uses MCP `remember`,
`recall`, `get_fact` and `read_doc` directly. It is distinct from temporary
working memory and agent-side watermarks.
